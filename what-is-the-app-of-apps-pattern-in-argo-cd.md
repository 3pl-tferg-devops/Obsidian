The "App of Apps" pattern is a way of organizing and deploying multiple applications with ArgoCD. 

In this pattern, you create a "parent" application that defines the desired state of multiple "child" applications.

This pattern can simplify and streamline the deployment process of multiple applications by managing them from a single point of control. 

Allowing you to deploy and manage all applications in a uniform and consistent manner, making it easier to maintain and update your entire application stack.
