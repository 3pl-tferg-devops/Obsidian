Here's an example of avoiding unnecessary or redundant words:

"In order to ensure that we have enough time to complete the project, we need to start working on it as soon as possible."

This sentence can be made more concise by removing the unnecessary words:

"To ensure we complete the project on time, we need to start working as soon as possible."

By removing the phrases "in order to" and "that we have enough time to", the sentence is more direct and to the point. It conveys the same message in fewer words, which makes it easier and quicker to read and understand.
