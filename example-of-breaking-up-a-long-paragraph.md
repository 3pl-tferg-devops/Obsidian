Here's an example of breaking up a long paragraph:

Before:

"The company's new marketing campaign has been in development for several months now, and it's finally ready to launch. The campaign is designed to appeal to a younger demographic, with a focus on social media and influencer marketing. The company hopes that this new approach will help them increase their market share and drive sales in the coming months.

To support the launch of the new campaign, the company has also hired several new employees, including social media specialists, content creators, and graphic designers. These new hires bring a wealth of experience and expertise to the team, and will be instrumental in ensuring the success of the new marketing campaign."

Breaking up the original paragraph into three smaller paragraphs makes the text more visually appealing and easier to read. It also helps to emphasize the main ideas of each paragraph and makes it easier for readers to follow the flow of the text.
