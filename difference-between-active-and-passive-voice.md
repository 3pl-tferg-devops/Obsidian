Active voice and passive voice are two different ways of structuring a sentence. In active voice, the subject of the sentence is doing the action, while in passive voice, the subject is being acted upon.

For example, consider the following sentence:

Active voice: The cat chased the mouse. Passive voice: The mouse was chased by the cat.

In the active voice sentence, the subject (cat) is doing the action (chased), while in the passive voice sentence, the subject (mouse) is being acted upon (chased by the cat).

Active voice is usually more direct, clear, and concise than passive voice, and is often preferred in writing. Passive voice can be useful in some situations, such as when the focus is on the object being acted upon rather than the subject doing the action. However, it can also be less clear and more awkward to read, especially if used excessively or unnecessarily.
