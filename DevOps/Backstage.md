## Install
Backstage is an open-source platform developed by Spotify that helps organizations manage their software development lifecycle. Here are the basic steps to set it up:

### Install Docker: 
Backstage runs as a set of Docker containers, so you'll need Docker installed on your machine. You can download Docker for your operating system from the Docker website.

### Install Node.js: 
Backstage requires Node.js to run. You can download Node.js from the Node.js website.
   
### Clone the Backstage repository: 
You'll need to clone the Backstage repository from GitHub. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/backstage/backstage.git
```
  
### Install dependencies: 
Navigate to the cloned Backstage repository and run the following command to install dependencies:
```bash
cd backstage 
yarn install --frozen-lockfile
```

### Start Backstage: 
Run the following command to start Backstage:
```bash
yarn start
```
This command will start the Backstage development server and open the application in your default web browser.

## Customize Backstage: 
Backstage can be customized with plugins. To add plugins, you'll need to create a new folder in the `plugins` directory and add a `package.json` file with the appropriate dependencies. 

You can find more information on how to create and add plugins to Backstage in the official documentation.
