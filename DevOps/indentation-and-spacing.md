It is recommended to:

	- Use four spaces for indentation
	- Keep your line length below 80 characters
	- Use a single blank line to seperate logical blocks of code
	- Place braces consistently
	- Add spaces around operators `x = y + z`
	- Use spaces around function parameters `functionName(x, y, z)`
