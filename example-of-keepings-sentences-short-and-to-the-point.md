Sure, here's an example of keeping sentences short and to the point:

"The sun was shining, the birds were singing, and the air was fresh and cool."

This sentence is short and straightforward, and each phrase contains a single idea. It's easy to read and understand, and doesn't require the reader to keep track of multiple clauses or ideas in a single sentence.

Compare this to a longer, more complex sentence:

"As the sun rose higher in the sky, the birds began to sing and flutter about, and the air became noticeably fresher and cooler, which made it quite pleasant to be outside on such a lovely day."

While this sentence conveys a similar idea, it is longer and more complex, and contains multiple clauses and ideas in a single sentence. This can make it harder to read and understand, and requires the reader to keep track of multiple ideas at once.
